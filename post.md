# Lab 3: Ramp Circuit

# Overview and Motivation
Welcome to the Lab 03 of CS281: Introduction to Computer Systems! 
This lab will use an analog input to display a number on a 7-segment display. A 7-segment display contains 7 leds that are arranged to form a number.. By the end of this lab, you'll be adept at working with essential circuit components and potentiometer.

# Objectives of the Lab
1. Familiarize yourself with the potentiometer and learn to control it.
2. Understand and construct an 7-segment display by using circuit chips and potentiometer.
3. Develop the ability to control data from potentiometer in a way to associate the input value to the number that will be displayed.
4. Gain hands-on experience in controlling circuits with the Arduino and potentiometer.

### 1. Project Step
The circuit for LED G is very simple. This only uses one OR gate and the inputs are B1 and B2. Then the wired to the pin of LED G with a resistor.
