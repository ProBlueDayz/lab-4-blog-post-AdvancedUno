# Lab 3: Ramp Circuit

# Overview and Motivation
Welcome to Lab 4 of CS281: Introduction to Computer Systems! <br>
This lab we will get deeper into the sensors and actuators. Sensors are devices that gather information from the environment, 
and actuators use that information to physically change the environment. 
We'll explore how to connect these components to an Arduino.

# Objectives of the Lab
1. Understand the basic operation of various sensors and actuators.
2. Learn how to connect sensors and actuators to an Arduino.
3. Design and build a project using sensors and actuators, document your process, and showcase it through a video.
   
# Materials
- PB-503 Breadboard prototyping station (integrated device with a number of electrical components like switches)
- Arduino Uno
- Wires
- Sensors (buzzer, ultrasonic sensor, photoresistor)
- Actuators (buzzer, servo motor)
- Multimeter 
- Resistors
- LED 
- Computer with Arduino IDE installed

# Overview: 

1. Buzzer: Learn how to control a buzzer using the Arduino to produce different tones.
2. Ultrasonic Sensor: Discover how to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances to objects and translate them into readings on the Arduino.
3. Distance Detector: Design a handheld device with an ultrasonic sensor that create tones based on the distance to objects (low pitch for close, high pitch for far).



# Building the Lab: 
## Buzzer

In this section, we will build a buzzer that generating sound. <br>
We will control the buzzer with a wave of pulses that we will generate. <br>

#### What we need
- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Breadboard
- Wires
- buzzer
- Computer with Arduino IDE installed

 
### 1. Project Step

- We will connect 5 voltage to + sign labeled pin in the buzzer and connect ground to the - sign labeled in the buzzer.
- "+" and "-" sign represent the metallic membrane inside the buzzer
#### Note: When a 5 voltage is applied to the input pids, the metallic membrane enters an excited state and without the voltage applied, it is contracted. This rotation create audible click
- By changing the voltage very frequently,  we can generate a sound 



### 2. Testing



## 1. Ultrasonic Sensor
Before we start with the design challenege, it is important to understand each individual device we will use before we combine them. First we will understand the ultrasonic sensor (aka sonar detector). This device records distance by sending out an ultrasonic ping and measures the  time it takes for the ping to return.
